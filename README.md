Hereâ€™s a simplified and generic README for your Airflow project:

---

# **Airflow DAGs**

This repository contains a collection of Apache Airflow DAGs showcasing various use cases, including ETL workflows, task orchestration, and Python operator usage. 

---

## **Repository Overview**

This project serves as a reference for building and managing workflows with Airflow. The DAGs in this repository demonstrate concepts like:

- ETL pipelines
- Task dependencies
- XCom usage
- Modular coding practices
- PySpark integration

---

## **Getting Started**

1. Place the DAG files in your Airflow DAGs directory:
   ```bash
   cp *.py ~/airflow/dags/
   ```
2. Start the Airflow webserver and scheduler:
   ```bash
   airflow webserver
   airflow scheduler
   ```
3. Open the Airflow UI (default: `http://localhost:8080`) to view and manage the DAGs.

## **Work in Progress**

More DAGs and features will be added to this repository. Stay tuned for updates!
